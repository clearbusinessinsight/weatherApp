05 Third-Party APIs: Work Day Scheduler
My Task
It was my task to create an application to allow users to add events to be accomplished later in the day and add them to the calendar for today. The events can be saved when the user clicks the save icon. The current date is to be displayed at the top of the screen.

The Acceptance Criteria
WHEN I open the planner
THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar I added the year even though it was not required
WHEN I scroll down
THEN I am presented with timeblocks for standard business hours
WHEN I view the timeblocks for that day
THEN each timeblock is color coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future
WHEN I click into a timeblock for a future event
THEN I can enter an event
WHEN I click the save button for that timeblock
THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage
WHEN I refresh the page
THEN the saved events persist
